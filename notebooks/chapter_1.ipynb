Compared to the mean, which uses all observations, the median depends only on the values in the center of the sorted data. While this might seem to be a disadvantage, since the mean is much more sensitive to the data, there are many instances in which the median is a better metric for estimating location. Let's say we want to look at typical household incomes in neighborhoods around Lake Washington in Seattle. In comparing the Medina neighborhood to the Windermere neighborhood, using the mean would produce very different results because Bill Gates lives in Medina. If we use the median, it won't matter how rich Bill Gates is - the position of the middle observation will remain the same.\n",

    "> From this boxplot we can immediately see that the median state population is about 5 million, half the states fall between about 2 and 7 million, and there are some high population outliers. The top and bottom of the box are the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. The median is shown by the horizontal line in the box. The lines, or *whiskers*, extend from the top and bottom fo the box to indicate the range for the bulk of the data. There are many variations of a boxplot. By default, *Matplotlib* extends the whiskers to the furthest point beyond the box, except that it will not go beyond 1.5 times the IQR. Any data outside of the whiskers is plotted as single points or circles (often considered as outliers)."
